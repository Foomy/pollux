## Pollux - Personal Media Library

Ever stand in a store and thought: "Did I already have this flick in my DVD collection?", or have you ever bought a new
blu-ray only to realize at home you now own it twice? Well, it happened to me, and not only once. And that's where
Pollux comes in. It's purpose is to help manage your medias like DVD, blu-ray or books.

If you're asking yourself now: "Who the f**k has still books, Blu-rays or even DVDs at home?" - Well I guess this tool
isn't for you. But I hope it will help some older Dudes like me.

### General Architecture

The idea is to manage a database with a web application. The second part then is a mobile app to read the data.

### Web Application

* Managing the library via all modern web browsers.

### Mobile App 

1. Real App; Not just a web site in disguise.
2. App works offline after database synchronization.
3. Mostly for read-only purposes.
4. Exception to 3. could be storing bar codes in the Database for later examination.

### More features in consideration

* Barcode scanner.
* Web scraper.
