## Pollux - Personal Media Library

Were you ever in a store and thought: "Did I already have this flick in my DVD collection?", or have you ever
bought a new blu-ray only to realize at home you now own it twice? Well, it happened to me, and not only once.
And that's where Pollux comes in, my personal solution to my very personal problem: My weird brain.

The main purpose of this is to help manage your medias like DVD, blu-ray or books.

If you're asking yourself now: "For Mike's sake, who the heck has still books, blu-rays or even DVDs at home?" -
Well I guess this tool isn't for you. - I admit, I build this primarily for me, but if some other dudes like and
use it once it is finished, I'm glad.

### General Architecture

The idea is to manage a database with a web application. The second part then is a mobile app to read the data.

### Web Application

* Managing the library via all modern web browsers.

### Mobile App 

1. Real App; Not just a web site in disguise.
2. App works offline after database synchronization.
3. Mostly for read-only purposes.
4. Exception to 3. could be storing bar codes in the Database for later examination.

### More features in consideration

* Barcode scanner.
* Web scraper.
